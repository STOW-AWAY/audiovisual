            <b>I WANTED TO BE A DOCTOR</b><br>
            The famous doctor held up Grandma's stomach.<br>
            Cancer! Cancer! he cried out.<br>
            The theatre was brought low.<br>
            None of the interns thought about Ambition.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cancer! They all looked the other way.<br>
            They thought Cancer would leap out<br>
            and get them. They hated to be near.<br>
            This happened in Vilna in the Medical School.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nobody could sit still.<br>
            They might be sitting beside Cancer.<br>
            Cancer was present.<br>
            Cancer had been let out of its bottle.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was lookinh in the skylight.<br>
            I wanted to be a doctor.<br>
            All the interns ran outside.<br>
            The famous doctor held on to the stomach.
        </p>
        <p>
            He was alone with Cancer.<br>
            Cancer! Cancer! Cancer!<br>
            He didn't care who heard or didn't hear.<br>
            It was his 87th Cancer.

                Found once again shamelessly ignoring the swans who in-<br>

                once again allowing the juicy contract to expire because the<br> 
                telephone has a magic correspondence with my tapeworm;<br>

                of long official repose while it is groomed to marble in <br>
                seedily historical back rooms; found once again humiliating <br>
                the bank clerk with eye-to-eye wrestling, art dogma, lives<br>
                of that loaf and stare, and other stage whispers of genius:<br>
                found once again the chosen object of heavenly longing<br>
                such as can ambush a hermit in a forest with visions of a<br>
                busy parking lot; found once again smelling mothball <br>
                sweaters, titling home movies, untangling Victorian salmon<br>
                rods, frnatically convinced that a world of sporty order is<br>
                just around the corner; found once again planning the ideal<br>
                lonely year which waits like first flesh love on a calendar of<br>
                third choices; found once again hovering like a twine-eating<br>
                kite over handds that feed me, verbose under the influence<br>
                of astrology; found once again selling out to accessible local<br>
                purity while Pentagon Tiffany evil alone can guarantee my<br>
                power; found once again trusting that my friends grew up<br>
                in Eden and will not harm me when at last I am armourless<br>
                and absolutely silent; found once again at the very begin-<br>
                ing, veteran of several useless ordeals, prophetic but not<br>
                seminal, the purist of the masses of tomorrow; found once<br>
                again sweetning life which I have abandoned, like a fired<br>
                zoo-keeper sneaking peanuts to publicized sodomized ele-<br>

                need; found once again cleansing my tongue of all possi-<br>

                The telephone is a fine instrument<br>
                but I never learned to work it very well<br>
                Five more rings and I'll put the receiver down<br>
                I know where it goes I know that much<br>
                The telephone was black with silver rims<br>
                The booth was cozier than the frugstore<br>
                There were a lot of creams and scissors and tubes<br>
                I needed for my body<br>
                I was interested in many coughdrops<br>
                I believe the drugstore keeper hated<br>
                His telephone and people like me<br>
                who ask for change so politely<br>
                I decided to keep to the same street<br>
                and go into the fourth drugstore<br>
                and call them again.

                When I hear you sing<br>
                Solomon<br>
                animal throat, eyes beaming<br>
                sex and wisdom<br>
                My hands ache from

                at God<br>

                <b>FOR MY OLD LAYTON</b><br>
                His pain, unowned, he left<br>
                in paragraphs of love, hidden<br>
                like a cat leaves shit<br>
                under stones, and he crept out in day,<br>
                clean, arrogant, swift, prepared<br>
                to hunt or sleep or starve.
            </p>
            <p>
                The town saluted him with garbage<br>
                which he interpreted as praise<br>
                for his muscular grace. Orange peels,<br>
                cans, discarded guts rained like ticker-tape.<br>
                For a while he ruined their nights<br>
                by throwing his shadow in moon-full windows<br>
                as he spied on the peace of gentle folk.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once he envied them. Now with a happy<br>
                screech he bounded from monument to monument<br>
                in their most consecrated plots, drunk<br>
                to know how closw he lived to the breathless<br>
                in the ground, drunk to feel how much he loved<br>
                the snoring mates, the old, the children of the town.
            </p>
            <p>
                Until, at last, like Timon, tired<br>
                of human smell, resenting even<br>
                his own shoe-steps in the wilderness,<br>
                he chased animals, wore live snakes, weeds<br>
                for bracelets. When the sea<br>
                pulled back the tide like a blanker<br>
                he slept on stone cribs, heavy,<br>
                dreamless, the salt-bright atmosphere<br>
                like an automatic laboratory<br>
                building crystals in his hair.
